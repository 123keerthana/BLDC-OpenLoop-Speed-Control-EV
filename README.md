# BLDC-OpenLoop-Speed-Control-EV
Developed and simulated a complete BLDC motor drive system for EV applications using MATLAB/Simulink, including mathematical modeling, trapezoidal back-EMF generation, Hall-based 120° commutation, PI speed control, and validation of line currents, torque ripple, and load disturbance response with dSPACE/OPAL-RT hardware framework.
